# Capstone-Project-Q2
Testing variations of COTTA for improved efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Please create and activate the following conda envrionment to recreate our experiment. Note that a Linux distribution is necessary to install the required anaconda packages. Note that an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA capabilities is necessary. 
```bash
# It may take several minutes for conda to solve the environment
conda update conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cotta 
```

## Classification Experiments
### CIFAR10-to-CIFAR10C-standard task
```bash
# Tested on RTX2080TI
cd cifar
# This includes the comparison of all three methods as well as baseline
bash run_cifar10.sh 
```

### CIFAR100-to-CIFAR100C task
```bash
# Tested on RTX3090
bash run_cifar100.sh
```
